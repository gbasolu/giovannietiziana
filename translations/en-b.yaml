betrothed:
  giovanni:
    I was born in Rosignano and after wandering around Italy, I landed in Manchester, where I work and live for a good part of the year.
    I am a software engineer with a passion for engines and speed, nature, mountains and traveling around the world.
    Reserved and rational, I am extremely sensitive and a little touchy.
    I love music even if on the dance floor I look more like a "bear".
    I love the night and sleeping late in the morning.
    You all complain because I never answer the phone, but maybe they haven't explained to you that the cell phone is used for playing "risk".
    I was looking for a "lady" with a special soul, with a brilliant mind and a big heart. And when I met Tiziana, I had no doubts.
    She won me over with her smile, her deep gaze and her delicious "guacamole".
    She was the one I had been waiting for for over 50 years and now I want her to become mine forever. Perfect for me. Perfect together.

  tiziana:
    I was born in Grosseto and I have lived my life around Italy and abroad.
    Restless, impulsive, stubborn and passionate. I've never lived on the surface.
    I am a lawyer with a passion for the sea, the sun and good wine.
    I love music, being around people and dancing until the morning.
    Traveling is my way of life.
    The most beautiful places I've been to?
    Mexico and Jordan but the most beautiful place is now in Giovanni's arms and my most beautiful journey begins today with him.
    My visceral connection with England, where I lived for many years, brought me to him,
    who conquered my heart with his voice, his complex mind and his still being a spontaneous and sincere child,
    capable of getting excited about small things. It was unlikely that our lives would intersect but fate had more imagination than us.
    Perfect for me. Perfect together.

    In this Church, which has a special meaning for us,
    the religious celebration will begin at 3 pm and our dear friend Don Giovanni Ricciardi will officiate it.

    While we will stop for a short photo shoot in the medieval village of Roccatederighi,
    our guests will be able to enjoy a delicious aperitif at "Fattoria La Principina", an enchanted place that seems to have come out of a fairy tale,
    a few kilometers outside Grosseto, immersed in the pine forest of the Maremma coast and a few steps from the sea.
    Our party will begin with the opening of the buffet around 6.30 pm, and will continue between one course and another,
    up to the wedding cake, with games, dancing and live music with the splendid voice of Alex Petrini.
    And, last but not least, we will be able to let loose and dance until late at night.
